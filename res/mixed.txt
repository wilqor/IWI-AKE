Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can
run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular
programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation)
and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax
from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally
released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also
developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler),
GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

The latest version is Java 8, which is the only version currently supported for free by Oracle, although earlier
versions are supported both by Oracle and other companies on a commercial basis.

Use

Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages as measured by the TIOBE
Programming Community Index. As of September 2015, it is in the fifth position. It was ranked as Programming Language
of the Year for the year 2007 and 2010. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not
predominantly based on C, e.g. C++, Objective-C (note, C# and Java only have partial syntactic similarity to C,
such as the use of curly braces, and are closer in similarity to each other than C).
An empirical study found scripting languages (such as Python) more productive than conventional languages (such as
C and Java) for a programming problem involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary. Memory consumption
was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".

Large organizations that make use of Python include Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, and some smaller ones like ILM, and ITA.

Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web
Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web application frameworks
like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design
and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjamas and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based
applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program
communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.

Libraries like NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized
libraries such as BioPython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. Sage is a mathematical software with
a "notebook" programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics,
numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.

Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language, including in finite
element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max,
Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke,
2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation program or scorewriter
capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes
Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been
adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.

Python has also been used in artificial intelligence tasks. As a scripting language with module architecture, simple
syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.

Many operating systems include Python as a standard component; the language ships with most Linux distributions,
AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X, and can be used from the terminal. A number of Linux distributions
use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the
Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.

Python has also seen extensive use in the information security industry, including in exploit development.

Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python.

The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its principal user-programming language.

LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Python Scripting Provider is a core feature
since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.
